# Quartzified Studios Protyping of the Project Torte!

<hr>

## What is in the Unity Project?

We are using Unity version 2019.4.21f and the only reason for this is due to the original project structure. The version should be able to be upgraded to 2020.3.XfX without any issues if that is wanted. We always though recommend that if you were to attempt to upgrade, to first make a backup just in case.

This version of Torte same as the other one after a lot of talking, uses URP (Universal Render Pipeline).

Packages we used:

- 2D Tilemap Extras
  - This allows for a lot of unique tiling which makes the work for the Unity Editors and Artist way easier!
- New Input System
  - Same as the old Project, allows for Keyboard & Mouse Controlls, as well as Controller (Untested now that I think about, but easy to fix).
- Probably some other stuff lol

## What do we recommend?

DO NOT ADD ANYTHING THAT DOES NOT NEED TO BE ADDED. 

We did not add wwise to the project nor will we personally ever consider it. Something as wwise seems mostly bloated to add and includes a lot of unnecessary complexity to everyone else who has access to the project. Even though it might be "used by a lot of people," that does not mean it should be used, especially since Unity already has such a system in place. Might not be as complex but, it has everything a game likes this would ever need.

You know actually... just dont add any other 3rd party assets... everything should already be here.

## What have we done?

We have as mentioned created the basic movement and interaction system. It should be very easy to understand. There is nothing complex going on as it is not required to be in any case. The Interaction system includes switching scene and doors a fade transition to mask the player teleportation. Also really easy to use.

You can currently interact with: NPCs, Doors and Elevators. Adding new Interactions is really really easy.

The NPC interaction includes a JRPG styled, chat sequence with that ability if needed as it was planned to add a Narrator Avatar to the chat.

We added 2 scenes: The Lab and the path leading to The Lab. (To showcase scene transition)
And as the scenes are all necessarily small and even with a transition effect before switching, there is no need to add a pre load scene method.

## Did it take long?

No, It actually probably took us less then 3 days to do all of it, potentially even 1. But we did not do any art (except for a wall sprite). Coding is the least time consuming part of a single player game, 90% of the time if you have a single person who know how to code. Art, Lore, Design on the other hand takes a lot of time and is the reason why it took longer to get to this point as we attempted to create some atmosphere and develope some lore yet Quartzi has decided to leave that to the Wheely Cat Studio, so that it can be talked through with everyone.

## We want to thank everyone!

Without Wheely Cat studios this whole project would not even exist. While Fauna is a very busy lady we as a group could most definetly get this done, and make an amazing game! Fauna will always have our back, and I hope so will you!
